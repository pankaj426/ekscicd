Learn howe 2x Faster Docker Build in AWS Cloud using AWS CodeBuild Cache system
Build Cache is so important part and many miss the point
1) Process time reduce by nearly up to 90%
2) Don't compile which is already compiled
3) Re-use the assets/artifacts that you have made
4) Don't pull the entire repo, instead just pull what exactly changes (saves a lot of time)
5) If you are building docker containers, it makes a lot of sense to store docker layers
6) If your dependencies are all downloaded from the internet, don't do it every time instead store in s3 so that download will be a lot faster

This list can go on and on...
